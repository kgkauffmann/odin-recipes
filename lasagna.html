                <ul>
                    <p class="recipe-title">Ingredients:</p>
                    <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
                    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried basil)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried parsley)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <p class="recipe-title">Instructions:</p>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, parsley, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat this process, alternating between sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture, until all the ingredients are used.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese on top of the lasagna.</li>
                    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This will make it easier to cut and serve.</li>
                    <li>Serve the lasagna hot, and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
                    <p>Feel free to adjust the recipe according to your preferences. You can add additional vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, or experiment with different cheeses to make it your own. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</p>
