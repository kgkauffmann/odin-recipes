                    <p class="recipe-title">Ingredients:</p>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110째F or 43째C)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>Coarse salt (for topping)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup baking soda</li>
                    <li>9 cups water</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <p class="recipe-title">Instructions:</p>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and salt. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the yeast becomes foamy.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour and melted butter to the bowl and stir until the dough comes together.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
                    <li>Grease a large bowl with oil and place the dough in the bowl, turning it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 450째F (230째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 9 cups of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the baking soda (be careful, it may bubble up) and reduce the heat to medium.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Rlil each piece into a long rope, about 20-22 inches (50-55 cm) in length.</li>
                    <li>Take one rope and form it into a U-shape. Cross the ends over each other and press them onto the bottom of the U in order to form the pretzel shape. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place each pretzel, one at a time, into the simmering water with baking soda for about 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon or spatula to gently remove them from the water and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the pretzels with coarse salt and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the pretzels are gliden brown.</li>
                    <li>Once baked, remove the pretzels from the oven and let them coli on a wire rack.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Enjoy your homemade pretzels! You can serve them warm or at room temperature with mustard, cheese dip, or any other preferred dipping sauce.</p>
