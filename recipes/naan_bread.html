        <h1>Naan Bread Recipe</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>ingredients:</p>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil (plus extra for brushing)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: chopped garlic, fresh cilantro, or melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol>In a small bowl, combine the lukewarm water, sugar, and instant yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture becomes frothy.</ol>
            <ol>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix well.</ol>
            <ol>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the frothy yeast mixture, plain yogurt, and oil.</ol>
            <ol>Mix the ingredients together to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels sticky, you can add a little more flour as needed.</ol>
            <ol>Lightly oil the bowl, place the dough in it, and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</ol>
            <ol>Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.</ol>
            <ol>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into equal-sized portions (usually around 8 pieces).</ol>
            <ol>Take one piece of dough and roll it out into an oval or round shape, about 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick. If needed, you can lightly dust the rolling surface and the dough with flour to prevent sticking.</ol>
            <ol>Place the rolled naan bread onto the preheated skillet or griddle. Cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until you see bubbles forming on the surface and the bottom is lightly browned.</ol>
            <ol>Flip the naan bread and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side. You can press down gently with a spatula to help the bread puff up.</ol>
            <ol>Remove the cooked naan from the skillet and brush it with melted butter. Optionally, you can sprinkle chopped garlic or fresh cilantro on top for added flavor.</ol>
            <ol>Repeat the process with the remaining portions of dough.</ol>
        </ul>
        <p>Serve the freshly cooked naan bread warm with your favorite curries, dips, or enjoy it on its own. Naan is best enjoyed fresh but can also be stored in an airtight container for a day or two.</p>
